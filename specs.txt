Vanguard MKII Specifications
----------------------------

The Vanguard MKII should be an improvement upon the Vanguard and only changes or different goals are specified in this document.

GOALS
- rugged airframe
- minimize weight of airframe and payload
- minimize airframe footprint for easy transportation
- live video feed paload (long range, low power consumption)

SUGGESTIONS

ruggedizing
- limit wingspan to 1500mm or smaller
- find new solution for the "bumper", is aerodynamically inefficient!

minimize weight
? possibly only add 1*5A 4S battery, reduces weight by 400g, might add considerable endurance
- reconsider servo size
- reduce engine power too 600W or 400W, smaller prop
- try to keep video tx power low for lower energy consumption
- keep wiring weight at minimum
- keep amount of electronic components down to a minimum

minimize footprint
- blunt nose for better lift distribution
- smaller prop for higher efficiency on the inner wing section
- optimize wing area for weight (deeper but less wingspan, might need another airofoil)

long range video
- move antennas to the outer wings
- don't use carbon fibre for the airframe

Misc
? trapez shaped flaps (wider on the outer sections) for better wing efficiency
? large winglets for high yaw stability
